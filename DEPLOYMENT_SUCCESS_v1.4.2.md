## 💡 Technical Notes

### Why -100vw instead of -85vw?
- Guarantees drawer is completely off-screen on all devices
- Accounts for browser rendering inconsistencies
- Better safe than sorry approach

### Why both click and touch handlers?
- Click events work on desktop
- Touch events needed for mobile (different timing)
- `preventDefault()` on touch prevents ghost clicks
- Ensures reliability across all devices

### Why pointer-events: none on backdrop?
- Prevents interference when backdrop is hidden
- Improves performance (no event processing)
- Cleaner event handling architecture

### Why will-change: right?
- Browser optimization hint for animations
- Promotes element to its own layer
- Results in smoother 60 FPS animations
- Minimal performance cost
